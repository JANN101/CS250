# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The customer wants what they want. Therefore, it is essential to completely understand what they are requesting. In this course, I have learned the best way with Agile is to "interview" the customer and create user stories. These stories break down each request of the customer, and details what each one is in a few sentences, and their intended outcome. These can then be used with the Scrum team to rate them by importance, be placed on the backlog, etc. User stories allow a team to better undersand the users needs.

A good program is only good if it meets its needs. You cannot have a good program without knowing what the end user wants. This is especially true nowadays where we see development companies getting larger and larger, becoming more out of touch with their user base. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

If I were to approach developing a program, it would depend if I were by myself or in a team of some sort. If I was by myself, I would probably use the traditional waterfall method since I am the only individual involved. If I was in a team, I would probably want to use an Agile framework in most cases, specifically Scrum. Scrum, as I have learned, uses teams with different roles. Agile-Scrum is good for larger, more complex projects that may need increased flexibility because of a broader idea or just a complex project. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member is essential in a group effort, especially while practicing Scrum or other Agile frameworks. A good team member should above-all have excellent communication. Good communication means they make every effort possible to understand what they should be doing and by being transparent with others. This can be done by chatting in person, asking questions via email or other digital means, participating in meetings, etc. Being a good team member also means you should maintain an open mind, collaborate with others, and have good listening skills. The saying of there is no I in team really does make sense, a good team member should be working with the rest of the team.
